    <P>Shall I compare thee to a summerâ€™s day?
<br>Thou art more <i>lovely</i> and more <strong>temperate:</strong>
<br>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
<br>And summer's lease hath all too short a <sup>date</sup>:
<br> <br>
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
<br>And often is his gold complexion<sub>dimm'ds</sub>
<br>And every fair from fair sometime declines,
<br>By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
<br> <br>
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
<br>Nor lose possession of that fair tho ow'st,
<br>Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
<br>When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
<br>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
<br> So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. 
    </P>
