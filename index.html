<div class="window">Welcome to my fan-made valorant site. Here I will teach you the game for various ranks/levels to help you improve. 
  <br><br>
  Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter and first-person shooter set in the near future.
  Players play as one of a set of agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world.
  In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. 
  Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, or spike actions. Check out more about the game on Valorant's official website:

<!-- //I created this classes called startspacer, this one is made to make gaps in-between the navgation, window (the window with text on the site) and infobar. 
This creates more space for the person visiting the site and it will become easier to read and look around without being confused where you are in the site.  -->
